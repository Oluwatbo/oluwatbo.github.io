# Data Analytics Portfolio
# Project 1
**Title:** [Sleep, Health, and Lifestyle Dashboard](https://github.com/Oluwatbo/oluwatbo.github.io/blob/main/Sleep_Health_Lifestyle%20Dataset.pbix)

**Tools Used:** Powerbi, Power Query Editor, Slicers, Conditinal Formating, DAX, Data Cleansing, Data Modelling

**Project Description:** The objective is to understand the relationship between sleep habits, health conditions, and lifestyle choices. This dataset provides insights into various aspects such as sleep duration, health conditions, physical activity levels, and demographic factors. By analysing this data, I aim to uncover patterns and correlations that could inform health recommendations and lifestyle improvements. The dataset includes information on sleep patterns, health metrics, lifestyle factors, and demographics.The key variables are sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity, health conditions (e.g., BMI Category, Blood Pressure), lifestyle choices (e.g., physical activity level, stress level), and demographic factors (e.g., age, gender).

**Key Findings:** Column chart showing short sleep duration is associated with higher prevalence of Sleep Apnea and Insomnia.
                  Line chart showing participants who engage in regular physical activity report better sleep quality.
                  Line chart and bar chart showing participants with high stress level and obese BMI respectively are correlated with poorer sleep quality.
                  Column chart showing Age Group 51-60 have a higher tendency towards adequate sleep duration compared to other age groups.
                  Bar chart showing participants who are Engineers have the longest sleep duration compared to other occupations.
                  Donut chart showing female participants tends to have more quality of sleep than male participants.

# Project 2
**Title:** [Customer Sales Data]

**SQL Code:** [SQL Query](https://github.com/Oluwatbo/oluwatbo.github.io/blob/main/Sales_Data.SQL)

**SQL Skills Used:** For Data Retrieval: 
                      SELECT queries to fetch specific data from tables.
                      FROM to specify the table.
                      JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables.
                      ON to specify two coumns from multiple tables that are the same.
                      WHERE clauses for filtering data based on specific conditions.
                      CROSS JOIN to combine each row of one table with each row of another table, and return the Cartesian product of the sets of rows from the tables that are joined.
                     For Data Filtering and Sorting:
                      ORDER BY for sorting data.
                      
**Project Description:** The project aims to analyse the relationships and performance metrics across sales, customers, and orders. By utilising SQL to interact with the database, the project focuses on extracting valuable insights such as sales performance, customer demographics, product popularity, and operational efficiency.

**Technology Used:** SQL Server

# Project 3
**Title:** [Supermarket Dashboard](https://github.com/Oluwatbo/oluwatbo.github.io/blob/main/Supermarket%20Sales%20Dashboard.pbix)

**Tools Used:** Powerbi, Power Query Editor, Slicers, Conditinal Formating, DAX, Data Cleansing, Data Modelling

**Project Description** The primary goal is to analyse the sales performance across different branches, product lines, customer demographics, and payment methods. The analysis will assist to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in making business decisions to optimise operations, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

Sales Analysis:
Assess total sales and number of transactions across different product lines, branches, and payment methods.
Identify peak sales periods and low-performing times.

Customer Insights:
Segment customers based on demographics such as gender and member status.

Product and Category Performance:
Determine the best-selling product line.
Determine the average rating by product line.

Operational Efficiency:
Measure the payment methods' popularity.

**Key Findings** Bar chart and column chart showing sales distribution by branch and product line. 
Insights: Identified the top-performing branches and popular product lines as Branch C and the "Food and beverages" category respectively.

Customer Demographics: Donut charts displayed the customer segments by gender and membership.
Insights: Identified the female customer segment is a bit higher than the male customer segment, and the proportion of members versus non-members is almost the same. 

Sales Trends Over Time: Line charts and bar charts showing sales trends on a monthly and time basis.
Insights: Identified peak sales month as "January" and time as "10:33AM" during the day, and analyse the trends.

Payment Methods and Transaction Analysis: Pie charts showing the distribution of payment methods.
Insights: Identified Cash payment methodas the most popular, which can guide payment processing decisions.

Product Rating: Area chart showing the ratings by product line
Insights: Identified the "Food and beverages" category having the highest average rating.
